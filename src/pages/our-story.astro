            Allovin, pronounced as /ɔːlʌvɪŋ/,means all love to kids and family.
            The blank of our logo heart means a space for self-growth of love.
            Not only a deep love from home, but learning to love ourself. The
            brand was founded by two moms of four lovely girls and boys. At the
            root of the company is a mom who loves design and art, and wanted
            more from the products they were using on her young children. The
            lovely brand has team members operating in New York, Paris, Milan,
            Shanghai, and Hangzhou, with team happily describing as the song
            "All About Lovin' You"."
